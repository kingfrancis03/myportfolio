    "professionally": "My Fullname is Francis Oscar Timbol Magtuto. I'm a Web Developer with a primary focus on back-end APIs(Python). Although my expertise lies in back-end development, I am also proficient in front-end development(VueJS) and handle those tasks when they are easy and no other developers are available. In my role, my main responsibility is to create REST APIs that retrieve data from databases or other third-party APIs and process it to meet the front-end requirements. I handle data validation and ingestion to ensure that the system's needs are met. Additionally, I am responsible for debugging and investigating any bugs or errors that may arise. In summary, my tasks primarily revolve around back-end development and coding; however, I also have the capability to handle front-end tasks when necessary.",
    "personally": "You can call me Francis. I'm a son, grandson, brother, uncle, churchmate, and a friend. I’m a proud follower and disciple of Jesus Christ.\n\nI love learning things that interest me. I'm kind of a geek when it comes to science and other stuff, but I'm not a genius like Sheldon from \"The Big Bang Theory.\" If something catches my interest, I'll research and think about it. I enjoy thinking, which is why I chose programming. Coding, for me, is like solving a puzzle—addressing problems and finding solutions. However, I'm not exceptionally smart; I just enjoy the process of thinking."
